Bayesian Optimization is a method used to solve black-box optimization problems where the analytical expression or derivatives of the optimization function \( f(x) \) is unavailable. It uses a surrogate model to approximate the objective function and an acquisition function to draw samples based on current observations to achieve better performance. This project explores Bayesian optimization methods and conducts experiments to tune the hyperparameters of machine learning models using datasets from sklearn. Results show that Bayesian optimization generally yields better results than random search.

## Introduction
Bayesian Optimization is effective for black-box optimization problems, where the optimization function is unknown, non-convex, or expensive to evaluate. It is particularly useful for hyperparameter tuning in machine learning models. Compared to grid search and random search, Bayesian optimization uses prior observations to guide the search, improving efficiency and performance.

## Black-Box Optimization Problem
Black-box optimization problems are characterized by unknown optimization functions without explicit analytical expressions or gradients. These problems often involve high-dimensional spaces and require significant computational resources. Bayesian optimization addresses these challenges by using surrogate models and acquisition functions to efficiently explore the search space.

## Bayesian Optimization
Bayesian optimization iteratively uses past observations to decide the next sample points, balancing exploration and exploitation. It typically involves:
1. Using a surrogate model (e.g., Gaussian Processes) to model the objective function.
2. Using an acquisition function to determine the next sampling point.
3. Updating the surrogate model with new observations.

## Methodology

### Surrogate Model
The surrogate model provides a probabilistic prediction of the objective function, incorporating prior knowledge and updating with new data.

### Acquisition Function
The acquisition function balances exploration of uncertain areas and exploitation of known good areas. It guides the selection of new sample points to maximize the efficiency of the search.


## Experiments

### Experiment Setting
We used two Bayesian optimization libraries, GPyOpt and BayesianOptimization, and conducted experiments on three sklearn datasets: breast cancer (binary classification), diabetes (regression), and iris (multi-class classification). We compared Bayesian optimization with random search.

### Results
Bayesian optimization consistently outperformed random search across different tasks and models. Detailed results for the breast cancer dataset, including F1 scores for various models, are shown below:

| Model              | F1 Score |
|--------------------|----------|
| SVM                | 0.771    |
| Random Forest      | 0.971    |
| Logistic Regression| 0.963    |
| K Nearest Neighbors| 0.953    |

## Challenges and Conclusion
Bayesian optimization faces challenges such as selecting appropriate surrogate models and acquisition functions, especially for high-dimensional problems. Customizing these components to specific optimization problems is crucial for effective application. Bayesian optimization is a powerful method for hyperparameter tuning in machine learning. It outperforms traditional methods like random search, providing better results with fewer evaluations. Future work can explore advanced surrogate models and acquisition functions to further improve performance.
